This study aims to propose a deep learning-based method to develop car-overtaking-truck prediction models while considering individual driving style estimations. 
DATA:
Existing naturalistic driving study data were used, and a total of 805 car-overtaking-truck events were extracted and analyzed.
METHOD:
Individual driving styles were firstly estimated by K-means clustering and Gaussian mixture distributions. The car-overtaking-truck maneuver (including speed, acceleration, and lane position) was then predicted by a deep learning method that combined Empirical mode decomposition with Long short-term memory (EMD-LSTM).
Conclusion:
Results showed that EMD-LSTM obviously reduced the time-delayed prediction problems with fewer time shifts. Prediction accuracy of the model was significantly increased by including driving styles.
